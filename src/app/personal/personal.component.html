	<p>I am an <a routerLink="/arduino">Arduino</a> enthusiest. I love technology and my boys, Damien and Gabriel.
		<br>
		<br>
		I love my boys more than anything, and they are quite amazing. I've lived in Chicago since I was 18 when I moved from Schaumburg where I lived my whole childhood. I love music and art and create art in various ways including drawing with charcoal or colord pencils and designing digital abstract images with photoshop.
		<br>
		<br>
		For now, please enjoy this photograph of an el horse riding alongside a standard horse that I created via Photoshop for my own enjoyment.</p>
