		description: 'I designed an automatic dog feeder and built the entire contraption. It automatically releases a designated amount of food twice per day based on a predetermined feeding schedule. An LCD display shows the current time, the quantity of times fed per day and the time in which the last feeding was released including manual feedings. A button allows for manual feeding. This is my favorite project as it is the most useful, most advanced and most fun to develop and build.',

It has manual on/off buttons as well. The light turns off shortly after it turns on if it detects motion. If you press the on button on the box or on the TV remote, it will stay on longer. If you press the off button on the box or TV remote, it will stay off for a much longer time. You can reset the the time with the stop button.\n\nI have several of these installed in my home with different configurations. For example, a secondary lamp in my living room turns on when I enter my front door but only for a minute. When I manually turn on the main lamp in my living room, it will stay on for several hours. It doesn't have a proximity sensor as I don't always want it on. The bathroom light box is installed inside the ceiling lamp compartment by modifying a light outlet-to-power adapter to feed power to the arduino and let the light bulb screw into it directly. This one is set to stay on for several minutes as not to suddenly make the bathroom pitch black on guests if they're not moving much. The hallway lamp also doesn't have buttons as it is in a bulb adapter on the ceiling. The wall switch can completely turn it off. The bedroom lamp goes off quickly but when manually pressing the power on button, it stays on long enough to read books to the kids.\n\nYou get the gist of it. There are many different configurations, but there is only one sketch (program) written. I simplly uncomment(enable) a line of code for whichever device I am configuring before uploading to the board.",

Each had it's own program and Arduino micro controller. It was also made difficult by using low quality products. I ended up having to use an Arduino Mega instead of Nano for the receiver because the Nano was not performing up to my expectations for speed. I had to switch out the 315 Mhz transmitter and receiver with two 2.4Ghz tranceivers because the interferance, stability and range was absolutely terrible. I had to attach capacitors to the tranceivers to increase range.\n\nâ¢Smart Tank: analyzes surroundings by looking around with a servo motor controlling an ultrasonic sensor and chooses where to go.\nâ¢Wired Remote Controlled Tank: remote controlled movement with a cable that runs to a controller.\nâ¢Wireless RF Remote Controlled Tank: uses two arduino boards.

I believe that this is enough to fend off intruders. If I were theoretically going to rob somebody and saw an LED start flashing red as I approached, I'd certainly flee the scene. Especially if it seems to be a home made security system. Who knows what kind of booby traps I could have laid out for them!",

		title: 'Heater Control',
		description: "I Modified a space heater to be able to power on after a given time. You can set a timer for the heater to power on. I use it for the morning so that I can get out of bed more easily in the winter. I Connected 4 wires to the heater's circuit board for the control panel. 2 wires to Power button on heater, 2 wires to Oscillation control button on heater. I fed them out through a hole I drilled.\n\nDetails:\nPress the button to add one hour to the timer. If you press it again, it will add another hour. Adding does not restart the timer. It starts when you press the button the first time and the first led turns illuminates. The LED indicators will illuminate based on how much time is left until the unit powers on. Manually power it on by holding the button down. Automatically powers off after two hours for safety. While on, press the button to turn it off manually and force it into safety mode. Press and hold when it's in safety mode until you see a bright blue light to bring it back to regular mode.",
