<h4>My story</h4>
<div class="box">
	Greetings. Over the last 5 years, I've been researching and taking online classes on Arduino (based on C/C++) and C#. Working with the Arduino prototyping platform has been my passion. You can view some of my main projects on this site. I've designed, coded and physically built electronics and machines. Ask me about this if you're intrigued! After ten years of various IT support/HelpDesk positions, I decided that I wanted to take my coding to the next level. I retired from my IT support career that I completely lost passion for in pursuit of a new exciting and rewarding career in software development.
	<br>
	<br>
	I enrolled in and completed a twelve week intensive full time coding course in downtown Chicago, called Coding Temple, focusing on .Net Core and related technologies. I not only majorly improved my C# skills, but I learned about and developed a skillset. Here, you will find a portfolio of projects that I've created. Apart from that, I have skills such as Graphic Design with Photoshop, Woodworking, Office foosball champion.

	<p>
		Please check out Interdimensional Things, my E-Commerce website. It is an MVC web app that I created in Visual Studio using .Net Core and MySQL. Hoseted on Microsoft's Azure cloud service, the site uses APIs such as Braintree's credit card authorization, SmartyStreet's address validation, and SendGrid's Email service.
		<br>
		<br>
		The site is where I sell things that I've encountered and acquired throughout my interdimensional travels. I wanted to have a way in which normal, non-interdimentional travelers, could discover and purchase things they never imagined possible. I've created it in such a way that nearly every mainstream species from our central finite curve can clearly read and understand how to use the site, how much things cost, and how long it will take for them to receive the things they choose.
